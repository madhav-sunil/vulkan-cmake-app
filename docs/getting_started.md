# Getting Started with Vulkan CMake Application

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- CMake (version 3.10 or higher)
- Vulkan SDK
- A C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang, MSVC)

## Setting Up the Project

1. **Clone the Repository**

   Clone the project repository to your local machine:

   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd vulkan-cmake-app
   ```

2. **Create a Build Directory**

   It is recommended to create a separate build directory:

   ```
   mkdir build
   cd build
   ```

3. **Configure the Project with CMake**

   Run CMake to configure the project:

   ```
   cmake ..
   ```

   This command will generate the necessary build files. Make sure that CMake can find the Vulkan SDK. If it is not found automatically, you may need to set the `Vulkan_DIR` variable to the path of the Vulkan SDK.

4. **Build the Project**

   After configuring, build the project using:

   ```
   cmake --build .
   ```

## Running the Application

Once the build is complete, you can run the application:

```
./vulkan-cmake-app
```

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter issues with finding the Vulkan SDK, ensure that the environment variables are set correctly. You may need to add the Vulkan SDK `bin` directory to your system's PATH.

- Check the CMake output for any errors or warnings that may indicate missing dependencies or configuration issues.
